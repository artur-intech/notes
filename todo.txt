- format `note.rb`. How to skip spaces. `trim_mode` does not work.
- js unit testing?
- full screen api for editing
- mobile support (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events)
- archive? trash bin?
- do not reload note list after deletion
- What does pressing ESC do when editing? Currently it is buggy.

- autoload from lib
- sanitize migration name
- unit tests without db access

done
